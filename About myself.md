Hello 👋, if you came here it's because you want to know a little more about me 😉, let me introduce myself. My name is César Costa Pessoa, but you can call me "Cesinha" it's a childhood nickname, it doesn't matter. I live in the East Zone of São Paulo - Brazil. Currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at Universidade Cruzeiro do Sul, and looking for an internship in the area, I want to collaborate in the development of programs for the evolution of your company 🏆❤️ , I still have basic knowledge of programming, such as: Python, SQL, Java and Javascript. Of course, I was already forgetting about my knowledge in web development (intermediate HTML and Intermediate CSS)...if you want more information. I leave my contact details below, and thank you for coming here.
